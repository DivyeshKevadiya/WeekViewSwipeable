# WeekViewSwipeable

WeekViewSwipeable is a simple Android view for displaying data in a weekly format. Given a list of data, the last element is bound to the current calendar day, the previous is bound to yesterday, and so forth. Simply override the adapter to customize the day circles based on your needs.

Usage
-----

```xml
    <com.yuncun.swipeableweekview.WeekViewSwipeable
        android:id="@+id/calendar_component"
        android:layout_width="match_parent"
        android:layout_height="wrap_content"
        android:layout_marginBottom="16dp"
        app:circleDefaultFillColor="@color/grey_500"
        app:circleDefaultStrokeColor="@color/grey_500"
        app:circleDefaultTextColor="@color/grey_750"
        />
```

Put your data into the `WeekViewAdapter`, and override whichever functions you need to customize.

```java
List<Boolean> data = Arrays.asList(true, false); //Example set; use your own List<T> here
WeekViewSwipeable wvs = (WeekViewSwipeable) findViewById(R.id.calendar_component);
WeekViewAdapter<Boolean> adapter = new WeekViewAdapter(data) {
    @Override
    public int getStrokeColor(final int index){
        //Override this to change circle stroke color
    }

    @Override
    public int getFillColor(final int index){
        //Override to change circle fill color
    }

    @Override
    public TextView getTextView(TextView tv, int index){
        //Gives you access to TextView
        return tv;
    }
    
    @Override
    public CircleView getCircleView(CircleView cv, int index){
        //Gives you access to CircleView
        return cv;
    }

    @Override
    public View getDayLayout(View dv, final int index){
        //Returns entire dayview. This could be useful for setting an onclicklistener, for example
        return dv;
    }
};
wvs.setAdapter(adapter);
```
